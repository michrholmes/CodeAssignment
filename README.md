# CodeAssignment

.NET Framework and C# Console application that searches for and uses an input file containing a number. 
Number is read from input file and used for a Fibonacci algorithm. 
The new value is then appended to output file.
Currently the input file is deleted after value is read from the input file.

Future improvements:
- Improved closure of program
- Option of deleting contents of input file instead of deleting input file itself
- Increase number capacity for Fibonacci algorithm. 
- Implement GUI
- Start/Stop functionality
- Separate file access threads for input and output with multithreading controls.
